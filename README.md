Secure Electronic Voting using Azure Blockchain


PROBLEM :>  In today's election we face many problems out of which major problem we face is tampering of EVM(or accusation) after the elections. 
SOLUTION :> What we can do is that we will store every vote that voter gives and making blocks(set of votes) using Asure Blockchain for sent it to Azure cloud for storing data. That will secure problem of tempering of EVM . But major problem we will face in this solution is that maximum transfer rate of ethereum blockchain is 29 blockes per second , but as per data even in State election  we will need much higher speed that is now not possible. 
So for this set of system we can think to apply this in small level for initial level, like in municipal corporation.

TECHNOLOGY :> Azure Cloud and Blockchain services, hash function(SHA-256).
